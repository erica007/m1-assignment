<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The Tiffanie, also known as the Longhaired Burmilla, is a new breed of cat that combines the clever affection of the Burmese with the temperament of the Chinchilla. The Tiffanie's long patterned silver coat is fine and silky, without a woolly undercoat. Their white or silver hair strands can be tipped with black, blue, brown, chocolate or lilac, giving a dusted appearance.</p>
<h2>LifeSpan</h2>
<p>Up to 17 years</p>
<h2>Grooming and care</h2>
<p>Tiffanies longer coats undergo two moulting seasons a year - following summer and winter. Brushing several times a week is required.</p>
<h2>Health Concerns</h2>
<p>Since Australian Tiffanies are a relatively new breed, they are likely to be healthier than other pure bred cats. Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is often seen in Chinchillas but Australian breeding standards deem that Tiffanies must test negative to this.</p>
