            <p>Identifying a Burmilla cat is best done by looking carefully at the cat’s markings and physical features.
                The cat’s fur, for instance, is thick and dense, and its ears are broad at the base and tilt forward
                slightly. Certain behaviors – like being affectionate, adventurous, and extroverts – might also tip you
                off that you’ve got a Burmilla cat on your hands. Alternately, you might take your cat to get a DNA test
                to confirm with greater accuracy whether the cat is a Burmilla.</p>

            <h2>LifeSpan</h2>
            <p>Up to 17 years</p>
            <h2>Grooming and care</h2>
            <p>Tiffanies longer coats undergo two moulting seasons a year - following summer and winter. Brushing
                several times a week is required.</p>
            <h2>Health Concerns</h2>
            <p>Since Australian Tiffanies are a relatively new breed, they are likely to be healthier than other pure
                bred cats. Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is often seen in Chinchillas but Australian breeding
                standards deem that Tiffanies must test negative to this.</p>
